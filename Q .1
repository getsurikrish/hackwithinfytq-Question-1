Hey Guys, there was a question in Round 2 of the HackWithInfy Contest which I feel is quite nice and I wasn't able to think of any possible solution to it. So the question goes like that:-
We have defined a function f(x) = sum of all the digits of x. Now,
0 <= i <= N
0 <= j <= N
We have to count how many pairs are there which satisfy the condition that f(i) + f(j) is a prime.
Constraints:- 0 <= N <= 10^50
Example:-
1) N = 2
pairs = 2
2) N = 3
pairs = 4

Solution :(python 3.4)
------------------------

import numpy as np
from itertools import *
def prime(v):
    for i in range(2,v//2+1):
        if v%i==0:
            return False
    return True
    
n=int(input())
c=0
li=np.arange(1,n+1,1)
for i in set(list(permutations(li,2))):
    if sum(i)%2 is not 0:
        if prime(sum(i)):
            c=c+1
print(c)
